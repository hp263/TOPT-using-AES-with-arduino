Time-based One-time password is to generate random pass word using time-based algorithm, such as Google authentication, 网易将军令,and etc.
For my prototype, each device has a unique serial number, which we need to enroll it first to connect to our account.
The device will generate a random 6-digit code every minutes, and the code only valid during that minute.
After you entering your correct account and password, you need to enter second password from the device.


Algorithms:
I am using Advanced Encrpt Standard (AES) algorithm to implement the TOPT, since I want to use algorithms that related to my cryptography class.


The serial number is an 16-byte sequence which is the key for AES in my algorithm, and current time is the plaintext in AES.

For arduino, I used DS 3231 high precised clock and LCD screen 1602 to display the code. It will read the current time from DS 3231 and 
then use AES to do the encrption. Since I am using AES 128, so I just pick some fixed position of bytes from cypher text and
only take one digit from each bytes.

In the screen, the first line is Hour:Minute:Second  Month Day Year 
the second line is the code.
