Time-based One-time password is to generate random passwords using time-based algorithm, such as Google authentication, 网易将军令, and etc.
For my prototype, each device has a unique serial number, which we need to enroll it first to connect to our account.
The device will generate a random 6-digit code every minute, and the code only valid during that minute.
After entering your correct account and password, you need to enter the second password from the device.


Algorithms:
I am using Advanced Encrypt Standard (AES) algorithm to implement the TOPT, since I want to use algorithms that related to my cryptography class.


The serial number is a 16-byte sequence which is the key for AES in my algorithm, and the current time is the plaintext in AES.

For Arduino, I used DS 3231 high precise clock and LCD screen 1602 to display the code. It will read the current time from DS 3231 and 
then use AES to do the encryption. Since I am using AES 128, so I just pick some fixed position of bytes from cipher text and
only take one digit from each byte.

In the screen, the first line is Hour:Minute:Second  Month Day Year 
the second line is the code.
